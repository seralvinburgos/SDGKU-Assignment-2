        <h2 class="bio">BIOGRAPHY</h2>

        <p class="p1"><b>Seralvin</b>, more commonly known as <b>Alvin</b>, was born in 1981 in <ins>Adak, Alaska</ins>. He has lived in several areas of the United States such as <ins>Long Beach, California</ins>; <ins>Corpus Christi, Texas</ins>; and <ins>Reisterstown, Maryland</ins>. Immediately after graduating from high school, <b>Alvin</b> joined the U.S. Air Force at the age of 17. He enlisted initially as an <i>Avionics Technician</i> and worked on airframes such as the U-2, F-16s, Warthogs, and the B-1 Bomber. However, one of <b>Alvin's</b> interests in life was to pursue a career in the medical field. After his first six years in the military, <b>Alvin</b> then transitioned to become an <i>Emergency Medical Technician</i>. After working several areas in the hospital, <b>Alvin</b> wanted more. He then became an <i>Independent Duty Medical Technician</i>, which gave him the freedom to work as the sole medical provider for various teams in some of the most remote areas around the globe. Just shy of 22 total years in the military, <b>Alvin</b> decided to hang it all up in order to make up for time lost with his family. In this next chapter of his life, he is finally and actively engaging in an area that he has always had an interest in and may one day, be able to call himself a web developer.</p>

        <h3 class="family">FAMILY</h3>

        <p class="p2"><b>Alvin</b> is married to his beautiful wife, <b>Enri Jean</b>. She put her potential career on hold in order to travel the world and offer her full support of <b>Alvin's</b> duties as a military spouse. Upon retirement, <b>Alvin</b> has taken the role of supporting Enri Jean with her new career as a <i>Realty Specialist</i> with the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers. They have two children together named <b>Nela</b> and <b>Aven</b>. <b>Nela</b> is 9 years old and was born in <ins>Tokyo, Japan</ins>. <b>Aven</b> is 5 years old and was born in <ins>Travis Air Force Base, California</ins>. Their family also includes a small Westie-mix dog named Siopao.</p>

        <h4 class="hobbies">HOBBIES</h4>

        <p class="p3">At the age of 40, <b>Alvin's</b> once active lifestyle has somewhat diminished and is now tailored around the interests and hobbies of his children. He is eager to learn anything and everything that stirs the minds of Nela and Aven, from skateboarding to hunting for insects. Camping and traveling still remains to be family-favorite activities and will always continue to be a tradition throughout the year.</p>
